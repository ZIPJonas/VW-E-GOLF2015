Find DBC for OBD2 data
Hello!
I am using a Canedge Can Bus datalogger from CSS Electronics to collect data from diffrent cars to try to understand the logics of the engine controllers.
For this one i am looking for a DBC that can convert as much raw info / PID from the OBD port as possible from a 2015 E-GOLF.
I am using https://canlogger.csselectronics.com/canedge-getting-started/log-file-tools/asammdf-gui/ to import and process data.
The database i have, can be found here: https://canlogger.csselectronics.com/canedge-getting-started/log-file-tools/asammdf-gui/dbc-convert-mdf4-data/
I am also attaching my log file from the EGOLF in the Repository.
If you are interested in Electric cars, please let me know if you can help me build a better DBC for this.
